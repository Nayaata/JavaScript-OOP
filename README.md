# JavaScript-OOP
Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses abstraction to create models based on the real world. OOP uses several techniques from previously established paradigms, including modularity, polymorphism, and encapsulation. Today, many popular programming languages (such as Java, JavaScript, C#, C++, Python, PHP, Ruby and Objective-C) support OOP.
